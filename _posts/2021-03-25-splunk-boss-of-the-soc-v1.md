This is a write up for the **Advanced Persistent Threat** and **Ransomware** tasks of the [**Splunk**](https://tryhackme.com/room/bpsplunk) room on [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com). Some tasks have been omitted as they do not require an answer.

## Advanced Persistent Threat

### What IP is scanning our web server?

Navigate to http://10.10.29.30:8000 and then click on **Investigating with Splunk Workshop**.

We know:
 * We have a compromised website: imreallynotbatman.com
 * An index called: botsv1

Lets start with a basic search:

```
index=botsv1 imreallynotbatman.com
```

This provides ~80,0000 results.

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/2021-03-25-splunk-boss-of-the-soc-v1/01-basic-query.jpg">

Something that is scanning our webserver is likely to be via HTTP, so lets set sourcetype to **stream:http**.

```
index=botsv1 imreallynotbatman.com sourcetype="stream:http"
```

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/2021-03-25-splunk-boss-of-the-soc-v1/02-source.jpg">

Lets see how many different ip addresses we are dealing with.

```
index=botsv1 imreallynotbatman.com sourcetype="stream:http" | stats count by src_ip
```

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/2021-03-25-splunk-boss-of-the-soc-v1/03-ip.jpg">

We can assume that due to the volume of traffic, this source ip is scanning our server.

> Answer: **40.80.148.42**

### What web scanner scanned the server?

Looking at some of the traffic from 40.80.148.42, we can see it is running Acunetix - a vulnerability scanner.

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/2021-03-25-splunk-boss-of-the-soc-v1/04-acunetix.jpg">

> Answer: **Acunetix**

### What is the IP address of our web server?

The requests from 40.80.148.42 are targetting 192.168.250.70

```
index=botsv1 imreallynotbatman.com sourcetype="stream:http" src_ip="40.80.148.42" | stats count by dest_ip
```

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/2021-03-25-splunk-boss-of-the-soc-v1/05-dest.jpg">

> Answer: **192.168.250.70**

### What content management system is imreallynotbatman.com using?

Looking at the dest_headers we can see that Joomla is likely to be the CMS in use.

```
index=botsv1 imreallynotbatman.com sourcetype="stream:http" src_ip="40.80.148.42" dest_ip="192.168.250.70" | top limit=20 dest_headers
```

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/2021-03-25-splunk-boss-of-the-soc-v1/06-joomla.jpg">

> Answer: **Joomla**

### What address is performing the brute-forcing attack against our website?

A brute force attack is against some form of authentication. This will likely require GET/POST requests.

```
index=botsv1 imreallynotbatman.com sourcetype="stream:http" dest_ip="192.168.250.70" | stats count by http_method
```

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/2021-03-25-splunk-boss-of-the-soc-v1/07-http.jpg">

Looking at the http_content for a request shows that the password field is called **passwd**.

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/2021-03-25-splunk-boss-of-the-soc-v1/08-passwd.jpg">

Refining our search further shows how many requests are coming from each ip.

```
index=botsv1 imreallynotbatman.com sourcetype="stream:http" dest_ip="192.168.250.70" http_method="POST" username passwd | stats count by src_ip
```

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/2021-03-25-splunk-boss-of-the-soc-v1/09-ip.jpg">

Listing **form_data** shows a brute force attempt on the **admin** user.

```
index=botsv1 imreallynotbatman.com sourcetype="stream:http" src_ip="23.22.63.114" dest_ip="192.168.250.70" http_method="POST" username passwd | top limit=20 form_data
```

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/2021-03-25-splunk-boss-of-the-soc-v1/10-brute.jpg">

> Answer: **23.22.63.114**

### What was the first password attempted in the attack?

The earliest entry will be at the **tail**.

```
index=botsv1 imreallynotbatman.com sourcetype="stream:http" src_ip="23.22.63.114" dest_ip="192.168.250.70" http_method="POST" username passwd | tail 1
```

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/2021-03-25-splunk-boss-of-the-soc-v1/11-pass.jpg">

> Answer: **12345678**

### One of the passwords in the brute force attack is James Brodsky's favorite Coldplay song. Which six character song is it?

This is an interesting query as we need to separate the passwords from the form_data.

```
index=botsv1 imreallynotbatman.com sourcetype="stream:http" src_ip="23.22.63.114" dest_ip="192.168.250.70" http_method="POST" username passwd 
| table form_data
| rex field=form_data "passwd=(?<passwd>\w+)" 
| table passwd 
| regex passwd= \w{6}
```

There is still 343 possibilities, sorting alphabetically reveals the answer.

### What was the correct password for admin access to the content management system running imreallynotbatman.com?

```
index=botsv1 imreallynotbatman.com sourcetype="stream:http" dest_ip="192.168.250.70" http_method="POST" username passwd 
| rex field=form_data "passwd=(?<passwd>\w+)" 
| stats count by passwd
| where count>1
```

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/2021-03-25-splunk-boss-of-the-soc-v1/13-batman.png">

> Answer: **batman**

### What was the average password length used in the password brute forcing attempt rounded to closest whole integer?

```
index=botsv1 imreallynotbatman.com sourcetype="stream:http" dest_ip="192.168.250.70" http_method="POST" username passwd 
| rex field=form_data "passwd=(?<passwd>\w+)" 
| eval length=len(passwd) 
| stats avg(length)
```

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/2021-03-25-splunk-boss-of-the-soc-v1/14-average.png">

> Answer: **6**

### How many seconds elapsed between the time the brute force password scan identified the correct password and the compromised login rounded to 2 decimal places?

```
index=botsv1 imreallynotbatman.com sourcetype="stream:http" dest_ip="192.168.250.70" http_method="POST" username passwd  | rex field=form_data "passwd=(?<passwd>\w+)"  | search passwd=batman 
| transaction passwd 
| eval dur=round(duration, 2)
| table dur
```
